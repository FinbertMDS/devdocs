### Magento components
The Magento application is made up of Modules, Themes, and Language Packages:

1. [Modules](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/architecture/archi_perspectives/components/modules/mod_intro.html) interact with other parts of the application to accomplish a particular business function or provide a feature. A module can contain a user interface for displaying information or interacting with the user. It can also contain application interfaces that another Magento module or code chunk might call.
   
2. [Themes](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/frontend-dev-guide/themes/theme-general.html) provide a personalized touch for each Magento installation by changing the look and feel of the storefront or Admin . Two themes are already available within the default Magento 2.x code structure: Blank theme and Luma theme. Refer to these default themes when creating custom themes.
   
3. [Language packages](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/frontend-dev-guide/translations/xlate.html) assist in internationalization(i18n) and localization by providing translations for strings that display on the storefront and Admin.
